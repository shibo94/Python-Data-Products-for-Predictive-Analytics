# Review: Regression Diagnostics
1.Why do we commonly use mean squared error (MSE) (versus mean absolute error or otherwise)?  
Because the MSE accounts for the probability of large errors versus that of small errors  
2.F​ill in the blank: "The MSE is proportional to the _________ of the data."  
v​ariance  
3.Which of the following correctly corresponds to R^2?  
1 - (MSE(f) / Var(y))  
C​orrect! Recall that MSE(f) / Var(y) is also known as FVU(f).  
1​ - FVU(f)  
C​orrect! Recall that FVU means "fraction of variance unexplained".  
4.W​hich of the following are desirable attributes for selecting training and testing sets?  
Both sets should be n​on-overlapping  
Both sets should be r​andomized
