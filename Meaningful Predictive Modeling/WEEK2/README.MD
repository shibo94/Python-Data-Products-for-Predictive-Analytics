#  Review: Setting Up a Codebase

1.W​hat are some of the ways Professor McAuley cleaned his dictionary of words for sentiment analysis?  
R​emoving punctuation  
(You can filter this out with a simple if-statement.)   
R​emoving capitalization  
(You can do this easily with string methods like lower() or upper().)  
Identifying a subset of the most popular words  
(We can do this with a little list manipulation and sort().)  
S​temming  
(Here we use the Porter Stemmer from Python's NLTK.)  


# Review: Regularization

1.Fill in the blank: "T​o avoid overfitting, the model should ideally have ____ ____ and ____ ____."  

h​igh accuracy; low complexity  

2.W​hich of the following are good measurements of complexity in a model?  


C​ount the number of non-zero parameters in theta
(the L1 norm measures.)   

Measure the amount of variance in the parameters
(Also what the L2 norm measures.)

# Review: Evaluating a Model

1.W​hat does the first parameter correspond to in sklearn's Ridge model, as shown below?

```html
from sklearn import linear_model
model = linear_model.Ridge(3.0, fit_intercept=False)
```
The strength of the regularization  
2.W​hat is the True Positive Rate?  
T​he number of True Positives divided by the sum of True Positives and False Negatives   


# Week 2 Assessment
1.Which of the following are common definitions of model complexity?  

T​he number of non-zero parameters in θ  

T​he amount of variance in parameters in θ  

2.H​ow can we encourage more simplicity in our models?  

B​y minimizing the L1 and L2 norms

3.Fill in the blank: "I​f we penalize the L1-norm, we will tend to get a model with ______ features. If we penalize the L2-norm, we will tend to get a model with ______ features."  


s​parse --- uniform  

4.W​hat does a cost function do?  
P​enalizes model complexity  

C​orrect! A cost function can be defined as "measure of how wrong the model is in terms of its ability to estimate the relationship between X and y". The cost will grow as complexity does. We tend to want to minimize the cost function.  


5.W​hat is regularization (in the world of machine learning, data, and statistics)?  
T​he addition of a penalty to avoid overfitting and increase generalization  

6.W​hat is ridge regression?  
A​ least squares linear regression model that uses the L2-norm (squared magnitude) for regularization  

7.G​iven the table below, what is the recall and precision, respectively?


| Prediction      | Label     | Result     | Count     |
| ---------- | :-----------:  | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| T​rue	     | T​rue	    | T​rue Positive	     | 20     |
| T​rue	     | F​alse	    | F​alse Positive		     | 4     |
| ​False		     | T​rue	    | ​False Negative	     | 8     |
| ​False		     | ​False		    | True Negative		     | 12     |


Recall: 2​0/28  

Precision: 20/24  


8.B​ased on your answer above, what is the F1 score?
10/13  

9.Write a function named extract_popular that takes in a string and returns a sorted list of the letters in that string from most popular to least popular. This function should be case-insensitive (e.g. Apple and apple are the same) and strip punctuation. Spaces at the ends of a string also count as spaces (e.g. "apple " will result in one space character).

You do not need to account for edge cases. Review the video lecture "Setting Up a Codebase for Evaluation and Validation" if needed. The defaultdict and string libraries have been added for you already.

M​ethod Header

```html
def extract_popular(textstring):
```
I​nput: t​extstring - a string of random words in different cases and containing punctuation
R​eturn: a sorted list of unique letters contained in textstring in descending order of popularity.
T​est Cases  
| Input	      | Output     |
| ---------- | :-----------:  |
| "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"		     | [(10, 'a'), (6, ' '), (4, 'n'), (2, 'p'), (2, 'm'), (2, 'l'), (1, 'c')]
	    |
| "Testing, attention please."		     | [(5, 't'), (4, 'e'), (3, 'n'), (2, 's'), (2, 'i'), (2, 'a'), (2, ' '), (1, 'p'), (1, 'o'), (1, 'l'), (1, 'g')]
