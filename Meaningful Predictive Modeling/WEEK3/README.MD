1.W​hat is the difference between sklearn's "Ridge" model and linear least-squares regression?  
T​he "Ridge" model includes a L2 regularization component  
2.F​ill in the blank: "When using iterative models, we should periodically compute the ______ error and stop once the error is no longer ______."  
v​alidation -- improving  
3.W​hich of the following are possible uses for the validation set?  

S​elect between model choices  

C​hoose between values of lambda  

G​uide feature engineering choices  

S​elect model parameters  
# Predictive Pipelines
1.W​hat are the assumptions we make when adhering to the testing/training/validation theorems introduced in this course?  

T​he testing/training/validation sets are randomly sampled  

T​he datasets we are using are large  
2.W​hich of the following are steps in a general validation pipeline?  
1-C​hoose a range of values for lambda  
2-T​rain a model and compute its validation error for each value of lambda  
3-C​hoose the model with the lowest validation error / highest accuracy  
4​-Evaluate the chosen model's performance on the test set.  

3.Write a function named split_dataset that takes in a list of features and a list of corresponding labels and splits them into training, validation, and test sets at a 60/20/20 ratio.  

I​nputs:  

X​ - a list of features  
y​ - a list of labels  
R​eturn:  

A​ list of all feature and label splits in the order of [X_train, X_validation, X_test, y_train, y_validation, y_test].  
T​est Cases:  

X​: [​"a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]  
y​: [​1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  
Return: [​ [​"a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"], ["g", "h"], ["i", "j"], [​1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,], [7, 8], [9, 10] ]  
```html
def split_dataset(X,y):
  N=len(X)
  X_train = X[:3*N//5]
  X_valid = X[3*N//5:4*N//5]
  X_test= X[4*N//5:]
  y_train = y[:3*N//5]
  y_valid = y[3*N//5:4*N//5]
  y_test = y[4*N//5:]
  return [X_train,X_valid,X_test,y_train,y_valid,y_test]
```
4.Y​ou tried out two models with regularization, one with a lambda of 10 and the other with a lambda of 100. The first model had a validation error of 0.5, while the second model had a validation error of 0.7. Which of the following are lambda values you should try next?  
0.1  
5  
8
