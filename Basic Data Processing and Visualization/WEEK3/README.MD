# Review: Data Filtering and Cleaning
1.Question 1  
W​hat are some reasons for cleaning or "pre-processing" datasets?  
S​ome parts of the dataset might have significant outliers    
S​ome parts of the dataset might be "stale" (outdated in a sense)  
F​ields might be missing from some entries  
S​ome data may need to be restricted to certain groups  
S​ome data may apply to only rare or inactive users  
S​ome entries might be poorly formatted  
2.H​ow might we filter a list of businesses based on their ratings and number of reviews? Assume "dataset" contains a complete cleaned dataset of businesses and relevant features.  
```html
dataset = [d for d in dataset if d['rating'] > 3.5 and d['num_reviews'] == 20]
```
3.W​hat are some ways we can filter reviews by?  
R​eview length  
R​eview quality  
U​ser activity  
R​eview rating D​ate  
User location
