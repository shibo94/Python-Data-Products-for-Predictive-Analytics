# Review: Getting Feature  
1.W​hy do we use one-hot encoding?  
B​ecause label encoding assumes an order to categorical variables (i.e. the higher, the better)  
T​o get a better representation of categorical variables in a dataset  
2.Y​ou want to build a piecewise model based on days of the week. Which of the following could be the one-hot encoding for this model's features?  
```html
M​onday: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
T​uesday: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Wednesday: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
Thursday: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Friday: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
Saturday: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
```
